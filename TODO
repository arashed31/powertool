Generic Wish list
--------------
1. Organize such that powertool is not the only utility that we can create
	- partially done
2. make file.d dependency files become .file.d files.

powertool wishlist
-----------------
1. make it a complete threaded model:
	- each pm bus is a seperate process or thread of it's own (allows simultaneous capture)
	- data collection and data computation per bus be split up into individual threads
		- This should allow for better accuracy of data collection

2. make ina driver not intrinsic to the program
	- use fops and generic data structures so that we can use other ADCs as well
	- Solve the configuration file problem (generic solution)

3. Add additional algorithm analysis modules
	- Simplistic averaging is not always a good idea, better might be to support
	normalization of data set etc..
